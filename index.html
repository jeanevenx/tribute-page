			<p id="img-caption"> Ada Lovelace has been called the world's first computer programmer. What she did was write the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper. <em>Source:<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/53131/ada-lovelace-first-computer-programmer">Mentalfloss</a></em> </p>

			<h4>Here's a time line of Ada Lovelace's life:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>1832</strong>:when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>1833</strong>: Lovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville, who introduced her to Charles Babbage.</li> <br>
				<li><strong>1835</strong>:She married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King..</li><br>
				<li><strong>1841</strong>:Ada wrote to her mother: "I am not in the least astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected."
				</li><br>
				<li><strong>1842â€“43</strong>:Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine.</li><br>
				<li><strong>1844</strong>:She commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings ("a calculus of the nervous system"). She never achieved this, however.</li><br>
				<li><strong>1852</strong>:Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852, from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians.</li>
